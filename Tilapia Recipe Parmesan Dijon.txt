Ingredients

    3 tablespoons reduced-fat mayonnaise
    1 tablespoon lemon juice
    2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
    1 teaspoon prepared horseradish
    2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese, divided
    4 tilapia fillets (5 ounces each)
    1/4 cup dry bread crumbs
    2 teaspoons butter, melted

Directions

    Preheat oven to 425°. Mix first four ingredients and 1 tablespoon cheese. Place tilapia on a baking sheet coated with cooking spray; spread evenly with mayonnaise mixture.
    Toss bread crumbs with melted butter and remaining cheese; sprinkle over fillets. Bake until fish just begins to flake easily with a fork, 12-15 minutes.

Health Tip: Tilapia is low in calories, rich in high-quality protein and a good source of many B vitamins.
